# Self-Installer - Guided Application Installation

This skill guides the user through the complete installation of THIS application by following the README.md instructions exactly.

## Installation Instructions Source

**CRITICAL**: All installation steps MUST follow the instructions in `README.md` under the "Getting Started" > "Installation" section and subsequent configuration sections. The README is the single source of truth.

Do NOT duplicate steps here. Always read and follow the README.md file for the actual installation procedure.

## Prerequisites

Before starting:
1. User must have or will create Clerk account
2. User must have or will create Convex account

## Installation Workflow

### Step 1: Ask User for Site Name and Billing Preference

Ask the user directly:
- Question: "What would you like to name your site?"
- Default option: Use current directory name (extract from `pwd`)
- Example: If current directory is `/Users/name/code/test3`, suggest `test3`

Then ask:
- Question: "Will this project use Clerk Billing for subscriptions/payments? (yes/no)"
- If **yes**: Billing setup will be included later
- If **no**: Billing setup will be skipped and billing components will be temporarily disabled

### Step 2: Initial Setup

Run these commands for the user:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `cp .env.example .env.local`
3. Generate CSRF secrets per README instructions

Then prompt:
```
I've set up the initial files. Please open .env.local in your editor - we'll be adding values to it throughout this process.

Set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME to: {site-name-from-step-1}
```

### Step 3: Clerk Configuration

Open the Clerk dashboard for the user:
```bash
open https://dashboard.clerk.com
```

Then prompt:
```
I've opened the Clerk dashboard. Please:

1. Sign in or create an account
2. Create a new application named "{site-name}"
3. Copy your API keys and add them to .env.local:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   - CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

4. Go to JWT Templates and create a "convex" template
5. Copy the Issuer URL and add it to .env.local:
   - CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=https://...

6. Go to Paths and set:
   - Sign-in URL: http://localhost:3000/sign-in
   - Sign-up URL: http://localhost:3000/sign-up
   - After sign-in URL: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   - After sign-up URL: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

Let me know when you've completed these steps.
```

Wait for user to respond before proceeding.

### Step 4: Convex Configuration

Open the Convex dashboard for the user:
```bash
open https://dashboard.convex.dev
```

Then prompt:
```
I've opened the Convex dashboard. Please:

1. Sign in or create an account
2. Create a new project named "{site-name}"
3. Go to Settings > Project Settings > Lost Access
4. Copy the command shown there (it looks like):
   npx convex dev --configure=existing --team your_team_name --project your_project_name

Let me know when you have the command copied.
```

Wait for user to respond with the command, then run it for them.

After running the configure command, prompt:
```
Convex is now configured. Your .env.local should have:
- CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:...
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://...convex.cloud

Now set this deployment as your default project environment:
1. In your Convex dashboard, go to Settings > Project Settings
2. Under "Default Deployment", select your dev deployment
3. This ensures `convex dev` uses the correct deployment by default

Then, still in your Convex dashboard, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add:
- CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN (same value as in .env.local)

Let me know when you've completed these steps.
```

Wait for user to respond before proceeding.

### Step 5: Webhook Setup

Prompt the user:
```
Now let's set up webhooks. In your Clerk dashboard:

1. Go to Webhooks
2. Create a new webhook endpoint:
   - URL: {NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL}/api/webhooks/clerk
   - Events: Select all user events and session events

3. Copy the Signing Secret

4. In your Convex dashboard, go to Settings > Environment Variables
5. Add: CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET={signing-secret}

Let me know when you've completed these steps.
```

Wait for user to respond before proceeding.

### Step 6: Billing Setup (Conditional)

**If user said YES to billing in Step 1:**

Prompt the user:
```
Now let's enable billing. In your Clerk dashboard:

1. Go to Billing > Subscription plans
2. Create a "Pro" plan at $9.99/month per README instructions

3. Go to Billing > Settings
4. Enable billing

Let me know when you've completed these steps.
```

Wait for user to respond before proceeding.

**If user said NO to billing in Step 1:**

Inform the user:
```
Since you're not using billing, I'll disable the billing components temporarily.
```

Then disable billing in the project:

1. **Update the payment-gated page** (`app/(app)/dashboard/payment-gated/page.tsx`):
   - Replace the content with a simple placeholder message
   - Example: "Payment features coming soon" or similar

2. **Update the pricing section** (find the pricing component on the landing page):
   - Replace or remove the `CustomClerkPricing` component
   - Can use static pricing cards or remove the section entirely

3. **Update sidebar navigation** (find the sidebar/nav component):
   - Remove or hide the "Payment gated" link

After making changes, inform the user:
```
Billing components have been temporarily disabled. You can re-enable them later by:
1. Setting up Clerk Billing in your dashboard
2. Reverting the changes I made to the payment-gated page and pricing section
3. Restoring the sidebar link

The original files are in git history if you need to restore them.
```

### Step 7: Deploy and Test

Run these commands:
```bash
npx convex dev --once
```

Then start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**If user said YES to billing:**

Prompt the user:
```
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000

Please test:
1. Visit the landing page
2. Sign in via /dashboard
3. Check the payment-gated page
4. Try the subscription flow with the test card

Let me know if everything is working!
```

**If user said NO to billing:**

Prompt the user:
```
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000

Please test:
1. Visit the landing page
2. Sign in via /dashboard
3. Verify the dashboard loads correctly

Let me know if everything is working!
```

## Critical Rules

### MUST Follow README Exactly

- **READ** README.md before each phase to get current instructions
- **NEVER** add environment variables not in README.md
- **NEVER** deviate from README step order or content
- **ONLY** use environment variables explicitly listed in README
- If README changes, this skill automatically follows new instructions

### Environment Variables

Only reference variables that appear in README.md `.env.local` configuration section.

**DO NOT** reference:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`
- Any other variables not in README

### User-Driven Approach

- Open URLs for the user using `open <url>` command
- Prompt the user with clear instructions for what to configure
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to next step
- User manually updates .env.local with values they copy from dashboards

## Error Handling

If any step fails:
1. Report the error with the README section reference
2. Show what was attempted
3. Suggest checking README.md for updated instructions
4. Allow user to retry or continue manually

## Success Output

## Maintainability

- Skill only orchestrates the workflow and guides the user
- When README updates, skill automatically follows new instructions
- No need to update this skill when installation process changes
